# Phase 2 Testing Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing results for the Transaction Set 271 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Response) implementation in Phase 2 of the EDI Parser project.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Parsing EDI 271 to JSON

#### Test Case: Parse Sample 271 EDI File
- **Input**: `demo/edi271-1.edi`
- **Output**: `out271.json`
- **Command**: `cargo run -- -f ./demo/edi271-1.edi -o out271.json`
- **Result**: Success

#### Observations:
- The parser successfully recognized the 271 transaction set
- All major structural elements were correctly parsed:
  - Interchange Control (ISA/GS)
  - Transaction Set Header (ST/BHT)
  - Hierarchical Loops (2000A, 2000B, 2000C, 2000D)
  - Eligibility Benefit Information (EB segments)
- Some segments were not captured in the output JSON:
  - PER segments (Contact Information)
  - REF segments (Reference Identification)
  - DTP segments (Date or Time Period)
  - MSG segments (Message Text)

### 2. Generating EDI 271 from JSON

#### Test Case: Generate 271 EDI from JSON
- **Input**: `out271.json`
- **Output**: `out271.edi`
- **Command**: `cargo run -- -f out271.json -o out271.edi -w -j`
- **Result**: Success

#### Observations:
- The generator successfully created a valid 271 EDI file
- All major structural elements were correctly generated:
  - Interchange Control (ISA/GS)
  - Transaction Set Header (ST/BHT)
  - Hierarchical Loops (2000A, 2000B, 2000C, 2000D)
  - Eligibility Benefit Information (EB segments)
- The generated EDI file was on a single line (no line breaks)
- The segments that were not captured during parsing were not present in the generated output

### 3. Comparison of Original and Generated EDI

#### Differences:
- Missing segments in the generated output:
  - PER segments (Contact Information)
  - REF segments (Reference Identification)
  - DTP segments (Date or Time Period)
  - MSG segments (Message Text)
- Formatting differences (single line vs. multiple lines)
- All core structural elements and required segments were preserved

## Conclusion

The Transaction Set 271 implementation is functional for basic use cases but requires additional work to fully capture all segments from the input file. The core parsing and generation functionality is working correctly, and the implementation follows the same pattern as the 270 transaction set, making it consistent with the rest of the codebase.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhance Segment Handling**:
   - Update loop structures to properly store and process all segments
   - Enhance parsing logic to capture all segments from input files

2. **Improve Validation**:
   - Add more validation rules for the 271 transaction set
   - Implement validation for required segments and fields

3. **Add More Test Cases**:
   - Create additional test files with different scenarios
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

4. **Fix Formatting Issues**:
   - Add option for pretty-printing EDI output with line breaks
   - Ensure consistent formatting between input and output
