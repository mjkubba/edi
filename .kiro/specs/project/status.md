# Current Implementation Status

## Completed Transaction Sets
- ✅ **EDI835** (Payment/Remittance Advice) - Fully functional
- ✅ **EDI999** (Implementation Acknowledgment) - Fully functional
- ✅ **EDI270** (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry) - Fully functional
- ✅ **EDI271** (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Response) - Fully functional
- ✅ **EDI276** (Health Care Claim Status Request) - Functional with differences
  - Successfully parses and generates core EDI276 structure
  - Some segments missing or have different values in output
- ✅ **EDI277** (Health Care Claim Status Response) - Functional with differences
  - Successfully parses and generates core EDI277 structure
  - TRN and STC segment handling working correctly
  - Some segments missing or have different values in output
- ✅ **EDI278** (Health Care Services Review) - Functional with minor differences
  - Successfully parses and generates core EDI278 structure
  - Properly handles UM segments with AR/HS prefixes
  - Some segments missing in output (DTP, SV2, PRV segments)
  - Line breaks in generated output (formatting difference only)
- ✅ **EDI837P** (Health Care Claim Professional) - Functional with differences
  - Successfully parses and generates core EDI837P structure
  - Several segments missing in output
- ✅ **EDI837I** (Health Care Claim Institutional) - Functional with differences
  - Successfully parses and generates core EDI837I structure
  - Specialized handling for CL1 segment
  - Several segments missing in output
- ✅ **EDI837D** (Health Care Claim Dental) - Functional
  - Successfully parses and generates core EDI837D structure
  - Specialized handling for TOO segment
- ✅ **EDI820** (Health Insurance Exchange Related Payments) - Partially functional
  - Successfully parses and generates basic EDI820 structure
  - Missing many segments in output (N1, ENT, NM1, RMR, DTM)
  - Needs significant improvement to preserve all segments

## Not Implemented
- ❌ **EDI834** (Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance) - Not implemented
  - Format not recognized by the parser
  - Needs to be implemented from scratch

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Transaction Set 834**
   - Create directory structure and module organization
   - Implement member-level detail segments (INS, HD, DSB)
   - Implement loop structures for enrollment and maintenance
   - Create controller with TransactionSet trait implementation
2. **Improve Incomplete Implementations**
   - Enhance the EDI820 implementation to preserve all segments
   - Improve the EDI837P and EDI837I implementations to preserve all segments
   - Fix segment order issues in generated files
3. **Code Cleanup**
   - Address compiler warnings, particularly unused imports and functions
   - Fix unused variable warnings
   - Improve code organization and documentation
4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize parsing algorithms for better performance with large files
   - Implement caching for frequently used segments
   - Reduce memory usage for large files
