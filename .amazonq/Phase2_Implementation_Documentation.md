### Timeline and Milestones
- Week 1: Common infrastructure updates
- Week 2-3: 270/271 transaction set implementation
- Week 4: Testing and refinement
- Future: 276/277 and 837 transaction set implementation

## 2. Common Infrastructure Updates

### Error Handling Module (`error.rs`)
- Created a standardized error handling system with specific error types
- Implemented proper error propagation with the `EdiResult<T>` type
- Added validation for required segments and fields

```rust
// Example implementation
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum EdiError {
    ValidationError(String),
    ParseError(String),
    IoError(std::io::Error),
    // Other error types
}

pub type EdiResult<T> = Result<T, EdiError>;
```

### Transaction Processor (`transaction_processor.rs`)
- Created the `TransactionSet` trait for standardized processing across formats
- Implemented methods for parsing and generating EDI content
- Added transaction type detection functionality

```rust
// Example implementation
pub trait TransactionSet {
    fn parse(&mut self, contents: String) -> EdiResult<()>;
    fn generate(&self) -> EdiResult<String>;
    fn get_transaction_type(&self) -> &str;
}
```

### Segment Configuration (`segment_config.rs`)
- Implemented a configuration-driven approach for segment definitions
- Created a registry for segment configurations
- Added common segment definitions

```rust
// Example implementation
pub struct SegmentConfig {
    pub segment_id: String,
    pub required_elements: Vec<usize>,
    pub max_elements: usize,
}

pub struct SegmentRegistry {
    configs: HashMap<String, SegmentConfig>,
}
```

### Loop Processor (`loop_processor.rs`)
- Implemented enhanced loop detection and processing
- Created a registry for loop configurations
- Added loop definitions for 835, 999, 270, and 271 formats

```rust
// Example implementation
pub struct LoopConfig {
    pub loop_id: String,
    pub parent_loop_id: Option<String>,
    pub trigger_segment: String,
    pub required_segments: Vec<String>,
}

pub struct LoopRegistry {
    configs: HashMap<String, LoopConfig>,
}
```

## 5. EDI835 Integration

### Function Name Refactoring
