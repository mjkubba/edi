# EDI Parser Implementation Status

## Transaction Set Status Overview

| Transaction Set | Status | Description |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| EDI835 (Payment/Remittance Advice) | ‚úÖ Complete | Fully functional with all segments correctly processed and generated |
| EDI270 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mostly Complete | Core functionality working, REF segments not included in output |
| EDI271 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Response) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Complete | Core functionality working, PER/REF/DTP segments not included in output |
| EDI999 (Implementation Acknowledgment) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Complete | Core functionality working, CTX segment formatting issues, trailer segments incomplete |
| EDI276/277 (Health Care Claim Status) | üîÑ In Progress | Basic structure implemented, needs further development |
| EDI837 (Health Care Claim) | üìù Planned | Not yet implemented |

## Recent Improvements

### EDI835
- Fixed REF segment in Table1 to ensure the qualifier (EV) is included
- Rewrote the write_per function to handle all cases correctly with proper field formatting
- Updated write_loop1000a function to properly handle PER segments with BL qualifier
- Reordered segments in write_loop2100 function to match expected order (AMT before PER)

### EDI270/271
- Improved parsing of REF, PER, and DTP segments
- Added support for MSG segments in EDI271
- Enhanced loop detection and segment assignment

### EDI999
- Improved CTX segment parsing
- Enhanced handling of multiple AK2 loops

## Known Issues

### EDI270
- REF segments are not included in the generated output
- Line breaks are not preserved in the generated output

### EDI271
- PER, REF, and DTP segments are not included in the generated output
- Line breaks are not preserved in the generated output

### EDI999
- CTX segment formatting issues (not all fields preserved)
- Trailer segments (SE, AK9, GE, IEA) missing values
- Line breaks are not preserved in the generated output

## Next Development Tasks

1. **EDI270/271**:
   - Modify write functions to include REF, PER, and DTP segments in output
   - Implement proper segment ordering

2. **EDI999**:
   - Fix CTX segment formatting to preserve all fields
   - Ensure proper values for trailer segments
   - Implement proper segment ordering

3. **General Improvements**:
   - Implement line breaks between segments in generated output
   - Address compiler warnings
   - Enhance error handling and validation

4. **New Transaction Sets**:
   - Complete EDI276/277 implementation
   - Begin EDI837 implementation
