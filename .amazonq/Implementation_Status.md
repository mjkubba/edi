## Recent Improvements

### EDI835
- Fixed REF segment in Table1 to ensure the qualifier (EV) is included
- Rewrote the write_per function to handle all cases correctly with proper field formatting
- Updated write_loop1000a function to properly handle PER segments with BL qualifier
- Reordered segments in write_loop2100 function to match expected order (AMT before PER)

### EDI270
- Fixed REF segments not being included in the generated output
- Fixed DTP segment parsing to correctly handle the segment ID
- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output for better readability
- Added test to verify REF segment handling

### EDI271
- Fixed PER, REF, and DTP segments not being included in the generated output
- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output for better readability
- Enhanced logging to show segment details
- Added test to verify unprocessed segments handling

### EDI999
- Fixed CTX segment formatting to properly handle special formats like "CLM01:123456789"
- Fixed CTX segment formatting to properly handle empty fields in the middle of the segment
- Added proper values for trailer segments (SE, AK9, GE, IEA)
- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output for better readability
- Added test to verify CTX segment handling and trailer segment values

### EDI276/277
- Enhanced loop processing for Loop2100A and Loop2100B
- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output
- Added comprehensive documentation to functions and structures
- Added unit tests for parsing and generating EDI files

- Added missing imports for write_ins and write_dtp functions
- Completed implementation of Loop2000C, Loop2000D, and Loop2000E
- Added support for STC segments in EDI277
- Added write functions for all loops and segments
- Updated main.rs to recognize 276/277 formats in input files
- Fixed PRV segment handling in both 276 and 277 implementations
- Implemented get_276 and get_277 functions in controller.rs
- Implemented write_276 and write_277 functions in controller.rs
- Added proper exports in mod.rs files
- Successfully parsing 276/277 files to JSON
- Fixed JSON to EDI conversion for 276 format by adding helper functions to fix segment IDs
- Fixed JSON to EDI conversion for 277 format by adding helper functions to fix segment IDs
- Improved segment ID handling to ensure proper output format
- Enhanced STC segment handling in EDI277 with proper formatting
- Implemented proper handling of nested loops in both 276 and 277 formats
- Added functional tests for EDI276/277 formats

### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed unused imports in multiple files
- Fixed unused variables by prefixing with underscore
- Added comprehensive documentation to helper module
- Added comprehensive documentation to main module
- Added comprehensive documentation to PER segment module
- Marked unused functions with #[allow(dead_code)] where appropriate

## Next Development Tasks

1. **General Improvements**:
   - Continue addressing remaining compiler warnings
   - Enhance error handling and validation
   - Add more comprehensive documentation to remaining modules

2. **New Transaction Sets**:
   - Begin EDI837 implementation
