- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output for better readability
- Added test to verify CTX segment handling and trailer segment values

### EDI276/277

- Implemented proper handling of nested loops in both 276 and 277 formats
- Added functional tests for EDI276/277 formats

### EDI837
- Created directory structure for 837P, 837I, and 837D variants
- Created basic module structure (mod.rs, controller.rs)
- Implemented common segments (interchangecontrol.rs, interchangecontroltrailer.rs)
- Set up table1.rs with basic segment structures
- Created initial loop structure in loop2000a.rs
- Implemented TransactionSet trait for 837P, 837I, and 837D variants
