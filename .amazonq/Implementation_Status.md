# EDI Parser Implementation Status

## Transaction Set Status Overview

| Transaction Set | Status | Description |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| EDI835 (Payment/Remittance Advice) | ‚úÖ Complete | Fully functional with all segments correctly processed and generated |
| EDI270 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry) | ‚úÖ Complete | Core functionality working, REF segments included in output, DTP segments fixed |
| EDI271 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Response) | ‚úÖ Complete | Core functionality working, PER/REF/DTP segments included in output, line breaks added |
| EDI999 (Implementation Acknowledgment) | ‚úÖ Complete | Core functionality working, CTX segment formatting fixed, trailer segments fixed, line breaks added |
| EDI276/277 (Health Care Claim Status) | üîÑ In Progress | Basic structure implemented, enhanced loop processing added, compilation errors need to be fixed |
| EDI837 (Health Care Claim) | üìù Planned | Not yet implemented |

## Recent Improvements

### EDI835
- Fixed REF segment in Table1 to ensure the qualifier (EV) is included
- Rewrote the write_per function to handle all cases correctly with proper field formatting
- Updated write_loop1000a function to properly handle PER segments with BL qualifier
- Reordered segments in write_loop2100 function to match expected order (AMT before PER)

### EDI270
- Fixed REF segments not being included in the generated output
- Fixed DTP segment parsing to correctly handle the segment ID
- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output for better readability
- Added test to verify REF segment handling

### EDI271
- Fixed PER, REF, and DTP segments not being included in the generated output
- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output for better readability
- Enhanced logging to show segment details
- Added test to verify unprocessed segments handling

### EDI999
- Fixed CTX segment formatting to properly handle special formats like "CLM01:123456789"
- Fixed CTX segment formatting to properly handle empty fields in the middle of the segment
- Added proper values for trailer segments (SE, AK9, GE, IEA)
- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output for better readability
- Added test to verify CTX segment handling and trailer segment values

### EDI276/277
- Enhanced loop processing for Loop2100A and Loop2100B
- Added line breaks between segments in the generated output
- Added comprehensive documentation to functions and structures
- Added unit tests for parsing and generating EDI files
- Identified compilation errors related to field name mismatches and missing imports

## Next Development Tasks

1. **EDI276/277 Fixes**:
   - Fix compilation errors related to field name mismatches
   - Add missing imports for write_ins and write_dtp functions
   - Fix test cases to match actual struct definitions
   - Complete implementation of Loop2000C, Loop2000D, and Loop2000E
   - Add support for STC segments in EDI277

2. **General Improvements**:
   - Address compiler warnings
   - Remove unused imports
   - Enhance error handling and validation

3. **New Transaction Sets**:
   - Begin EDI837 implementation
