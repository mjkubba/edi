## Recent Improvements

### LS/LE Loop Handling
- Fixed the LS/LE segment handling in Loop2110C
- Improved the detection of NM1*P3 segments within LS/LE loops
- Fixed the generation of LS/LE segments with proper loop identifier codes

### Segment Content Fixes
- Fixed PER segment handling to correctly extract function code and other fields
- Fixed REF segment handling to correctly extract qualifier and reference number
- Fixed DTP segment handling to correctly extract date/time fields
- Fixed MSG segment handling to correctly extract message text

### REF Segment Support in EDI270

- Implemented process_remaining_segments function to handle unprocessed REF segments
- Fixed segment parsing to correctly extract qualifier and reference number

## EDI Format Specifications
The `markdown_files` directory contains specifications for various EDI transaction sets:
- 270/271 - Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry/Response
- 276/277 - Health Care Claim Status Request/Response
- 278 - Health Care Services Review
- 820 - Payment Order/Remittance Advice
- 834 - Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance
- 835 - Health Care Claim Payment/Advice
- 837 - Health Care Claim (Professional, Institutional, Dental)
- 999 - Implementation Acknowledgment

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Segment Order**: Implement a more precise segment ordering system
2. **Add Line Breaks**: Add line breaks between segments in generated output
3. **Fix Duplicate DTP Segments**: Ensure DTP segments are not duplicated
4. **Clean Up Warnings**: Address compiler warnings
5. **Implement Transaction Set 276/277**: Health Care Claim Status
6. **Implement Transaction Set 837**: Health Care Claim
