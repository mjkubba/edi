## Project Status

- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete - Fixed CTX segment implementation, improved error handling, addressed Table 1 content placement
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Complete - Implemented common infrastructure and additional transaction sets (270/271)
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - Implementing 276/277 and 837 transaction sets

## Recent Improvements

### EDI999 Implementation
- Verified that CTX segment handling is working correctly
- Confirmed that multiple AK2 loop handling is functioning properly
- Validated that the loop structure matches the standard X12 999 format
- Ensured that parsing and generation functions are working correctly

### LS/LE Loop Handling
- Fixed the LS/LE segment handling in Loop2110C
- Improved the detection of NM1*P3 segments within LS/LE loops
- Fixed the generation of LS/LE segments with proper loop identifier codes

### Segment Content Fixes
- Fixed PER segment handling to correctly extract function code and other fields
- Fixed REF segment handling to correctly extract qualifier and reference number
- Fixed DTP segment handling to correctly extract date/time fields
- Fixed MSG segment handling to correctly extract message text

### REF Segment Support in EDI270
- Added support for REF segments in Loop2000C
- Implemented process_remaining_segments function to handle unprocessed REF segments
- Fixed segment parsing to correctly extract qualifier and reference number

### Duplicate DTP Segments Fix
- Fixed issue with duplicate DTP segments in EDI271 output
- Implemented segment filtering by qualifier to ensure proper loop assignment
- Added duplicate detection and prevention mechanisms
- Added final deduplication step in output generation
- Comprehensive testing confirms fix works across all formats

## EDI Format Specifications
The `markdown_files` directory contains specifications for various EDI transaction sets:
- 270/271 - Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry/Response
- 276/277 - Health Care Claim Status Request/Response
- 278 - Health Care Services Review
- 820 - Payment Order/Remittance Advice
- 834 - Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance
- 835 - Health Care Claim Payment/Advice
- 837 - Health Care Claim (Professional, Institutional, Dental)
- 999 - Implementation Acknowledgment

## Next Steps for Phase 3

1. **Create Directory Structure for 276/277**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/edi276/segments src/edi276/loops src/edi276/controller
   mkdir -p src/edi277/segments src/edi277/loops src/edi277/controller
   ```

2. **Implement Common Segments for 276/277**:
   - Reuse existing segment definitions (BHT, HL, TRN, REF, DMG, DTP, NM1, PER)
   - Implement new segments for 277 (STC, AAA, QTY, AMT)

3. **Define Loop Structures for 276/277**:
   - Implement Loop2000A, Loop2000B, Loop2000C, Loop2000D, Loop2000E
   - Implement Loop2100A, Loop2100B, Loop2100C, Loop2100D, Loop2100E
   - Implement Loop2200C, Loop2200D, Loop2200E for 277

4. **Create Controllers for 276/277**:
   - Implement Edi276 and Edi277 structs
   - Add parsing and generation functions
   - Implement transaction type detection

5. **Implement 837 Transaction Set**:
   - Create directory structure for 837P, 837I, and 837D variants
   - Implement common segments and loops
   - Implement variant-specific components

6. **Improve Formatting**:
   - Add line breaks between segments in generated output
   - Enhance segment order logic to better match original files
   - Clean up compiler warnings
