This directory contains documentation for the EDI Parser project, including implementation details, testing results, and future plans.

## Project Documentation

### Implementation Details
- [Phase2_Implementation_Documentation.md](Phase2_Implementation_Documentation.md) - Detailed documentation of Phase 2 implementation
- [Implementation_Results_and_Improvements.md](Implementation_Results_and_Improvements.md) - Summary of improvements made during Phase 2

### Testing Results
- [Testing_Results_and_Analysis.md](Testing_Results_and_Analysis.md) - Comprehensive testing results and analysis

### Project Overview
- [Project_Specification_and_Overview.md](Project_Specification_and_Overview.md) - High-level overview of the project

## Recent Improvements

### LS/LE Loop Handling
- Fixed the LS/LE segment handling in Loop2110C
- Improved the detection of NM1*P3 segments within LS/LE loops
- Fixed the generation of LS/LE segments with proper loop identifier codes

### Segment Content Fixes
- Fixed PER segment handling to correctly extract function code and other fields
- Fixed REF segment handling to correctly extract qualifier and reference number
- Fixed DTP segment handling to correctly extract date/time fields
- Fixed MSG segment handling to correctly extract message text

### REF Segment Support in EDI270
- Added support for REF segments in Loop2000C
- Implemented process_remaining_segments function to handle unprocessed REF segments
- Fixed segment parsing to correctly extract qualifier and reference number

## EDI Format Specifications
The `markdown_files` directory contains specifications for various EDI transaction sets:
- 270/271 - Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry/Response
- 276/277 - Health Care Claim Status Request/Response
- 278 - Health Care Services Review
- 820 - Payment Order/Remittance Advice
- 834 - Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance
- 835 - Health Care Claim Payment/Advice
- 837 - Health Care Claim (Professional, Institutional, Dental)
- 999 - Implementation Acknowledgment

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Segment Order**: Implement a more precise segment ordering system
2. **Add Line Breaks**: Add line breaks between segments in generated output
3. **Fix Duplicate DTP Segments**: Ensure DTP segments are not duplicated
4. **Clean Up Warnings**: Address compiler warnings
5. **Implement Transaction Set 276/277**: Health Care Claim Status
6. **Implement Transaction Set 837**: Health Care Claim

## Recent Updates - April 29, 2025

### Duplicate DTP Segments Fix
- Fixed issue with duplicate DTP segments in EDI271 output
- Implemented segment filtering by qualifier to ensure proper loop assignment
- Added duplicate detection and prevention mechanisms
- Added final deduplication step in output generation
- Comprehensive testing confirms fix works across all formats

### Next Steps
1. **Improve Segment Order**:
   - Implement a more precise segment ordering system
   - Consider a configuration-driven approach to segment ordering
   - Ensure generated files match the segment order of original files

2. **Add Line Breaks**:
   - Add line breaks between segments in the generated output
   - Implement a configurable formatting option for output files

3. **Fix Segment Formatting Issues**:
   - Address formatting issues in REF and PER segments in EDI835
   - Fix CTX segment formatting in EDI999

4. **Clean Up Warnings**:
   - Address compiler warnings to improve code quality
   - Remove unused imports and variables
   - Fix other code quality issues

5. **Implement Transaction Set 276/277**:
   - Create directory structure and module organization
   - Implement segment and loop structures
   - Implement controllers and processing logic

6. **Implement Transaction Set 837**:
   - Create directory structure for 837P, 837I, and 837D variants
   - Implement common segments and loops
   - Implement variant-specific components
