### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ EDI834 (Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance) - Not started

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of Transaction Set 834
   - Create directory structure and module organization
   - Implement member-level detail segments (INS, HD, DSB)
   - Implement loop structures for enrollment and maintenance
   - Create controller with TransactionSet trait implementation
2. Code Cleanup
   - Address compiler warnings, particularly unused imports and functions
   - Fix unused variable warnings
   - Improve code organization and documentation

### Next Steps
1. Complete implementation of Transaction Set 278
   - Fix test failures and field naming issues
   - Complete loop structure implementation
   - Add validation for 278-specific requirements
   - Add comprehensive tests
2. Begin implementation of Transaction Set 820
3. Begin implementation of Transaction Set 834
4. Start performance optimization work
5. Implement advanced features
