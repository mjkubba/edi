# EDI Parser Testing Results - May 2025

## Testing Overview

This document summarizes the results of comprehensive testing performed on all implemented transaction sets after recent modifications to the EDI Parser project. The testing was conducted to validate the functionality of each transaction set and identify any remaining issues that need to be addressed.

## Test Methodology

- Parse EDI files to JSON and verify structure
- Generate EDI files from JSON and verify structure
- Compare original and generated EDI files
- Identify unprocessed segments and structural differences

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Parse EDI to JSON
cargo run -- -f ./demo/edi835-1.edi -o ./demo/test835-new.json

# Generate EDI from JSON
cargo run -- -f ./demo/test835-new.json -o ./demo/test835-new.edi -w -j

# Compare files
diff ./demo/edi835-1.edi ./demo/test835-new.edi
```

## 1. EDI835 (Payment/Remittance Advice) Testing

### Status: ✅ Fully functional

#### Test Results
- **Parse Test**: Successfully parsed all segments including REF and PER segments
- **Generate Test**: Successfully generated all segments in the correct order
- **Comparison**: No differences found between original and generated files

#### Key Improvements
- Fixed REF segment in Table1 to ensure the qualifier (EV) is included
- Rewrote the write_per function to handle all cases correctly with proper field formatting
- Updated write_loop1000a function to properly handle PER segments with BL qualifier
- Reordered segments in write_loop2100 function to match expected order (AMT before PER)

#### Conclusion
The EDI835 implementation is now fully functional with all segments correctly processed and generated. The changes have successfully addressed the issues with REF and PER segments.

## 2. EDI270 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry) Testing

### Status: ⚠️ Mostly functional

#### Test Results
- **Parse Test**: Successfully parsed all segments including REF segments
- **Generate Test**: Generated most segments but REF segments are missing in the output
- **Comparison**: Only formatting differences (line breaks) and missing REF segments

#### Observations
- The parser correctly identifies REF segments (as shown in the logs: "Found unprocessed REF segment, adding to appropriate loop")
- REF segments are not included in the final output
- The generated file has all segments on a single line without line breaks

#### Needed Improvements
- Modify the write functions to properly include REF segments in the output
- Implement line breaks between segments in the generated output

## 3. EDI271 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Response) Testing

### Status: ⚠️ Partially functional

#### Test Results
- **Parse Test**: Successfully parsed all segments including PER, REF, DTP, and MSG segments
- **Generate Test**: Generated core segments but PER, REF, and DTP segments are missing in the output
- **Comparison**: Missing PER, REF, and DTP segments in the output

#### Observations
- The parser identifies PER, REF, and DTP segments (as shown in the logs)
- These segments are not included in the final output
- The MSG segment is correctly included in the output
- The generated file has all segments on a single line without line breaks

#### Needed Improvements
- Modify the write functions to properly include PER, REF, and DTP segments in the output
- Implement line breaks between segments in the generated output

## 4. EDI999 (Implementation Acknowledgment) Testing

### Status: ⚠️ Partially functional

#### Test Results
- **Parse Test**: Successfully parsed most segments including CTX segments
- **Generate Test**: Generated most segments but with formatting issues
- **Comparison**: CTX segment formatting issues and missing values in SE, AK9, GE, and IEA segments

#### Observations
- CTX segments are correctly parsed but not all fields are preserved in the output
- The SE, AK9, GE, and IEA segments are included but without their values
- The generated file has all segments on a single line without line breaks

#### Needed Improvements
- Fix CTX segment formatting to preserve all fields
- Ensure proper values for trailer segments (SE, AK9, GE, IEA)
- Implement line breaks between segments in the generated output

## Overall Assessment

1. **EDI835**: Our changes have successfully fixed the issues with REF and PER segments. The implementation is now fully functional.

2. **EDI270/271**: While the parser correctly identifies all segments, there are still issues with including REF, PER, and DTP segments in the final output. This suggests that we need to modify the write functions to properly include these segments.

3. **EDI999**: The CTX segment handling has improved but still needs work to preserve all fields. The trailer segments (SE, AK9, GE, IEA) need to be properly populated with values.

## Next Steps

1. **EDI270/271**: Modify the write functions to properly include REF, PER, and DTP segments in the output.

2. **EDI999**: Fix the CTX segment formatting and ensure proper values for trailer segments.

3. **General**: Address the formatting differences by implementing line breaks between segments in the generated output.

4. **Code Cleanup**: Address compiler warnings to improve code quality.

The changes we made to the EDI835 implementation have been successful, but we need to apply similar fixes to the other formats to ensure consistent behavior across all transaction sets.
