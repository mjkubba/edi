### 2. ✅ Fix EDI271 Implementation
- [x] Modify write functions to include PER segments in output
- [x] Modify write functions to include REF segments in output
- [x] Modify write functions to include DTP segments in output
- [x] Add line breaks between segments in generated output
- [x] Update controller.rs to ensure all segments are properly processed
- [x] Add tests to verify segment handling

### 3. ✅ Fix EDI999 Implementation
- [x] Fix CTX segment formatting to preserve all fields
- [x] Fix CTX segment formatting to handle special formats like "CLM01:123456789"
- [x] Fix CTX segment formatting to handle empty fields in the middle of the segment
- [x] Ensure proper values for trailer segments (SE, AK9, GE, IEA)
