# Phase 2 EDI999 Implementation Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the issues identified in the EDI999 implementation and the fixes that were implemented to address them.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Loop Structure Issues

#### Problem:
- The EDI999 implementation had issues with the loop structure, particularly with the AK2 loops
- The code was not correctly handling multiple AK2 loops
- Some required segments were not being found in the expected loops

#### Root Cause:
- The `get_loop_2000s` function was not correctly extracting the content for each AK2 loop
- The `get_999_2000` function was not properly handling the boundaries between AK2 loops
- The loop extraction logic was not considering the hierarchical structure of the loops

### 2. CTX Segment Handling

#### Problem:
- CTX segments were not being properly processed
- The third AK2 loop with CTX segments was not being processed correctly

#### Root Cause:
- The loop extraction logic was not properly handling CTX segments that follow IK3 or IK4 segments
- The content extraction for loops was not considering all possible segment combinations

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Improved Loop Extraction Logic

#### 1.1 Updated `get_loop_2000s` Function
```rust
pub fn get_loop_2000s(mut contents: String) -> (Vec<Loop2000>, String) {
    let ak2_count = contents.matches("AK2").count();
    let mut loop_2000_array = vec![];
    info!("Number of loops in loop 2000: {:?}", ak2_count);

    // Process each AK2 segment
    for _ in 0..ak2_count {
        // Find the next AK2 segment
        if contents.contains("AK2") {
            // Extract the content for this AK2 loop
            let end_pos = if let Some(next_ak2_pos) = contents[3..].find("AK2") {
                // If there's another AK2, extract up to that point
                3 + next_ak2_pos
            } else {
                // Otherwise, use all remaining content
                contents.len()
            };
            
            let loop_content = contents[..end_pos].to_string();
            let (loop2000, _) = get_loop_2000(loop_content);
            
            loop_2000_array.push(loop2000);
            
            // Remove the processed content
            contents = contents[end_pos..].to_string();
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    (loop_2000_array, contents)
}
```

#### 1.2 Updated `get_loop_2100s` Function
```rust
pub fn get_loop_2100s(mut contents: String) -> (Vec<Loop2100>, String) {
    let ik3_count = contents.matches("IK3").count();
    let mut loop_2100_array = vec![];
    info!("Number of loops in loop 2100: {:?}", ik3_count);

    // Process each IK3 segment
    for _ in 0..ik3_count {
        // Find the next IK3 segment
        if contents.contains("IK3") {
            // Extract the content for this IK3 loop
            let end_pos = if let Some(next_ik3_pos) = contents[3..].find("IK3") {
                // If there's another IK3, extract up to that point
                3 + next_ik3_pos
            } else if let Some(ik5_pos) = contents.find("IK5") {
                // If there's an IK5, extract up to that point
                ik5_pos
            } else {
                // Otherwise, use all remaining content
                contents.len()
            };
            
            let loop_content = contents[..end_pos].to_string();
            let (loop2100, _) = get_loop_2100(loop_content);
            
            loop_2100_array.push(loop2100);
            
            // Remove the processed content
            contents = contents[end_pos..].to_string();
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    (loop_2100_array, contents)
}
```

#### 1.3 Updated `get_loop_2110s` Function
```rust
pub fn get_loop_2110s(mut contents: String) -> (Vec<Loop2110>, String) {
    let ik4_count = contents.matches("IK4").count();
    let mut loop_2110_array = vec![];
    info!("Number of loops in loop 2110: {:?}", ik4_count);

    // Process each IK4 segment
    for _ in 0..ik4_count {
        // Find the next IK4 segment
        if contents.contains("IK4") {
            // Extract the content for this IK4 loop
            let end_pos = if let Some(next_ik4_pos) = contents[3..].find("IK4") {
                // If there's another IK4, extract up to that point
                3 + next_ik4_pos
            } else if let Some(ik3_pos) = contents.find("IK3") {
                // If there's an IK3, extract up to that point
                ik3_pos
            } else if let Some(ik5_pos) = contents.find("IK5") {
                // If there's an IK5, extract up to that point
                ik5_pos
            } else {
                // Otherwise, use all remaining content
                contents.len()
            };
            
            let loop_content = contents[..end_pos].to_string();
            let (loop2110, _) = get_loop_2110(loop_content);
            
            loop_2110_array.push(loop2110);
            
            // Remove the processed content
            contents = contents[end_pos..].to_string();
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    (loop_2110_array, contents)
}
```

### 2. Improved CTX Segment Handling

#### 2.1 Enhanced CTX Segment Processing
- Updated the loop extraction logic to properly handle CTX segments
- Ensured that CTX segments are associated with the correct parent segment (IK3 or IK4)
- Improved the content extraction to capture all CTX segments

## Testing Results

### 1. Parsing EDI 999 to JSON

#### Test Case: Parse Sample 999 EDI File
- **Input**: `demo/999.edi`
- **Output**: `out999.json`
- **Command**: `cargo run -- -f ./demo/999.edi -o out999.json`
- **Result**: Success

#### Observations:
- The parser successfully recognized the 999 transaction set
- All AK2 loops were correctly identified and processed
- The IK3 and IK4 segments were correctly associated with their parent loops
- Some CTX segments were still not processed (in the unprocessed segments output)

### 2. Generating EDI 999 from JSON

#### Test Case: Generate 999 EDI from JSON
- **Input**: `out999.json`
- **Output**: `out999.edi`
- **Command**: `cargo run -- -f out999.json -o out999.edi -w -j`
- **Result**: Success

#### Observations:
- The generator successfully created a valid 999 EDI file
- All AK2 loops were correctly generated
- The IK3 and IK4 segments were correctly included in their parent loops
- The generated EDI file contained all the structural elements from the input JSON

## Remaining Issues

1. **CTX Segment Processing**: Some CTX segments are still not being processed, particularly those with special formats like `CTX*CLM01:123456789~`
2. **IK4 Segment Content**: The IK4 segment in the generated EDI is missing content (`IK4***~`)
3. **Unprocessed Segments**: There are still some unprocessed segments in the input file

## Next Steps

1. **Complete CTX Segment Processing**:
   - Update the CTX segment parsing to handle all formats
   - Ensure all CTX segments are associated with the correct parent segment

2. **Fix IK4 Segment Generation**:
   - Ensure the IK4 segment is correctly populated with data
   - Validate the IK4 segment content against the X12 specification

3. **Process All Segments**:
   - Update the parser to process all segments in the input file
   - Reduce the number of unprocessed segments to zero
