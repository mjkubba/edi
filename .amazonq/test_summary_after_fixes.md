# EDI Parser Testing Results After Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of testing the EDI Parser after implementing fixes for the issues identified in the previous testing round.

## Test Methodology

For each transaction set, we performed the following steps:
1. Parse an EDI file to JSON
2. Generate an EDI file from the JSON
3. Compare the original and generated EDI files

## Results by Transaction Set

### EDI999 (Implementation Acknowledgment)

**Status**: ✅ Significantly Improved

The EDI999 format now shows significant improvements:
- The SE segment now correctly includes the transaction set control number (2870001)
- The AK9, GE, and IEA segments now have proper values
- Line breaks and formatting are consistent

The only remaining differences are minor formatting issues in the original file (extra spaces after tildes) which don't affect the semantic meaning of the EDI document.

### EDI270 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry)

**Status**: ✅ Significantly Improved

The EDI270 format now shows significant improvements:
- The DTP and EQ segments are now properly preserved and included in the output
- The REF segment is now preserved, though there's still a minor issue with the qualifier

Remaining issues:
- The REF segment qualifier is still changed from "SY" to "REF"
- The EQ segment has an extra "EQ" prefix in the first field

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes have significantly improved the EDI Parser's ability to preserve all segments and fields in the EDI files. The EDI999 format is now almost perfectly preserved, with only minor formatting differences. The EDI270 format is also much improved, with all segments now being preserved, though there are still some minor issues with field values.

### Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **EDI270**:
   - Fix the REF segment qualifier handling to preserve the original "SY" value
   - Fix the EQ segment handling to avoid duplicating the segment ID in the first field

2. **General**:
   - Continue addressing compiler warnings
   - Add more comprehensive tests to verify segment-level fidelity across all formats
   - Consider adding validation to ensure generated EDI files conform to the X12 standards

### Next Steps

1. Address the remaining issues in the EDI270 format
2. Implement similar fixes for the EDI276/277 formats
3. Begin implementation of the EDI837 format
