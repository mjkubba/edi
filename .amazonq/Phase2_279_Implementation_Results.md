## Testing Results

### 1. X279-generic-request-by-clinic-for-patient-(subscriber)-eligibility.edi (270 Format)

#### Before Implementation
- DTP and EQ segments were not processed
- Generated EDI file was missing these segments

#### After Implementation
- Successfully parsed and processed DTP and EQ segments
- Generated EDI file includes all segments from the original file
- Segment order matches the original file

### 2. X279-response-to-generic-request-by-clinic-for-patient-(subscriber)-eligibility.edi (271 Format)

#### Before Implementation
- NM1*P3 segment within LS/LE loop was not properly processed
- LS segment was missing the loop identifier code in the generated file
- Generated EDI file was missing the NM1*P3 segment

#### After Implementation
- Successfully parsed and processed NM1*P3 segment within LS/LE loop
- Generated EDI file includes the NM1*P3 segment
- LS/LE segments properly wrap around the NM1*P3 segment

**Original File Segment Order (relevant portion):**
```
EB*B**1>33>35>47>86>88>98>AL>MH>UC*HM*GOLD 123 PLAN*27*30*****N~
LS*2120~
NM1*P3*1*JONES*MARCUS****SV*0202034~
LE*2120~
```

**Generated File Segment Order (relevant portion):**
```
EB*B**1>33>35>47>86>88>98>AL>MH>UC*HM*GOLD 123 PLAN*27*30*****N~
LS*~
NM1*P3*1*JONES*MARCUS****SV*0202034~
LE*~
```

**Note:** The loop identifier code is still missing in the LS/LE segments, which will be addressed in the next phase.

## Identified Issues

### 1. LS/LE Loop Identifier Code
- The LS/LE segments are missing the loop identifier code in the generated file
- The loop identifier code should be "2120" but is currently empty

### 2. Segment Order
- Some differences in segment order still exist in the 271 response file
- The TRN segment appears in a different position in the generated file

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix LS/LE Loop Identifier Code
- Update the LS segment structure to properly handle the loop identifier code
- Ensure the loop identifier code is correctly parsed and generated

### 2. Improve Segment Order
- Enhance the segment ordering logic to better match the original files
- Implement a configuration-driven approach to segment ordering

### 3. Add Validation
- Add validation for required segments and elements
- Implement checks for segment order and structure

## Conclusion

The implementation of Phase 1 has significantly improved the EDI parser's capabilities for handling 270/271 formats, particularly the X279 variants. The parser now correctly processes DTP and EQ segments in the 270 format and properly handles NM1*P3 segments within LS/LE loops in the 271 format.

While there are still some issues to address, such as the missing loop identifier code in LS/LE segments and some differences in segment order, the parser is now much more capable of handling real-world EDI files. The next phase of implementation will focus on fixing these remaining issues and adding validation to ensure the generated files match the expected format.
