# EDI Parser Testing Results Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of testing the EDI Parser's ability to convert EDI files to JSON and back to EDI for various transaction sets (835, 999, 270/271, 276/277).

## Test Methodology

For each transaction set, we performed the following steps:
1. Parse an EDI file to JSON
2. Generate an EDI file from the JSON
3. Compare the original and generated EDI files

## Results by Transaction Set

### EDI835 (Payment/Remittance Advice)

**Status**: ✅ Successful

The EDI835 format was successfully parsed to JSON and back to EDI with no differences between the original and generated files. This indicates that the parser correctly handles all segments and fields in the 835 format.

### EDI999 (Implementation Acknowledgment)

**Status**: ⚠️ Partial Success

The EDI999 format was successfully parsed to JSON, but there were some differences in the generated EDI file:
- The SE segment is missing the transaction set control number
- The AK9, GE, and IEA segments are missing some values
- There are some formatting differences (line breaks and spacing)

These differences suggest that while the core functionality is working, there are still some issues with generating the trailer segments correctly.

### EDI270 (Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry)

**Status**: ⚠️ Partial Success

The EDI270 format was successfully parsed to JSON, but there were some differences in the generated EDI file:
- The REF segment qualifier was changed from "SY" to "REF"
- The DTP and EQ segments were missing in the generated output

This indicates that while the parser can handle the basic structure of the 270 format, it's not preserving all segments and fields correctly.

### EDI276/277 (Health Care Claim Status Request/Response)

**Status**: ⚠️ Significant Differences

Both EDI276 and EDI277 formats showed significant differences between the original and generated files:

**EDI276 Issues**:
- The generated file has line breaks between segments while the original is a single line
- Many segments are missing in the generated output (DMG, TRN, AMT, DTP, etc.)
- Some segment qualifiers are changed (e.g., PR*2 to PR*PR)
- The hierarchical structure is simplified

**EDI277 Issues**:
- Similar to EDI276, many segments are missing
- The hierarchical structure is significantly simplified
- An unexpected "SEPH" segment appears in the output

## Conclusion

The EDI Parser shows varying levels of success across different transaction sets:

1. **EDI835**: Fully functional with excellent fidelity
2. **EDI999**: Mostly functional with minor issues in trailer segments
3. **EDI270**: Partially functional with some missing segments
4. **EDI276/277**: Basic functionality working but with significant data loss

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **EDI999**: Fix the trailer segment generation to include all required values
2. **EDI270**: Ensure all segments (especially DTP and EQ) are preserved during processing
3. **EDI276/277**: 
   - Improve segment preservation to include all segments from the original file
   - Fix segment qualifier handling to maintain original values
   - Enhance hierarchical structure handling to preserve the full hierarchy

### Next Steps

1. Address the identified issues in order of priority:
   - Fix EDI999 trailer segments
   - Fix EDI270 missing segments
   - Enhance EDI276/277 implementation to preserve more data

2. Add more comprehensive tests to verify segment-level fidelity across all formats

3. Consider adding validation to ensure generated EDI files conform to the X12 standards
