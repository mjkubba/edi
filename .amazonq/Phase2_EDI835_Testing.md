# Phase 2 EDI835 Testing Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing results for the EDI835 implementation in Phase 2 of the EDI Parser project. The testing was conducted to identify any issues with the existing EDI835 functionality and to determine the best approach for integrating it with the new transaction sets.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Parsing EDI 835 to JSON

#### Test Case: Parse Sample 835 EDI File
- **Input**: `demo/edi835-1.edi`
- **Output**: `out835.json`
- **Command**: `cargo run -- -f ./demo/edi835-1.edi -o out835.json`
- **Result**: Success

#### Observations:
- The parser successfully recognized the 835 transaction set
- All segments were correctly parsed and stored in the appropriate data structures
- The JSON output contained all the information from the input EDI file
- No errors or warnings were reported during parsing

### 2. Generating EDI 835 from JSON

#### Test Case: Generate 835 EDI from JSON
- **Input**: `out835.json`
- **Output**: `out835.edi`
- **Command**: `cargo run -- -f out835.json -o out835.edi -w -j`
- **Result**: Success

#### Observations:
- The generator successfully created a valid 835 EDI file
- All segments were correctly generated from the JSON data
- The generated EDI file was identical to the original input file
- No errors or warnings were reported during generation

### 3. Comparison of Original and Generated EDI

#### Differences:
- No differences were found between the original and generated EDI files
- The `diff` command returned an exit status of 0, indicating identical files

## Issues Identified

### 1. Function Name Mismatch

#### Problem:
- The main application was expecting a function named `write_835` but the actual function is named `write_edi`
- This mismatch caused compilation errors when trying to build the application

#### Solution:
- Updated the lib.rs file to re-export the `write_edi` function instead of the non-existent `write_835` function
- Modified the main.rs file to use the `write_edi` function for generating 835 EDI files
- These changes allowed the application to compile and run successfully

### 2. Error Handling Differences

#### Observation:
- The EDI835 implementation uses a different error handling approach compared to the new transaction sets
- The EDI835 functions return default values instead of using the Result type
- This inconsistency makes it difficult to provide a consistent API across all transaction sets

#### Impact:
- The EDI835 implementation works correctly but doesn't follow the same patterns as the new transaction sets
- This inconsistency makes the codebase less maintainable and harder to extend

## Conclusion

The EDI835 implementation is fully functional and works correctly for parsing and generating EDI files. The only issues identified were related to function naming and error handling patterns, which can be addressed in future refactoring efforts.

The testing confirmed that the EDI835 functionality is critical and should be preserved, but it would benefit from being updated to use the same error handling patterns as the new transaction sets.

## Recommendations

### 1. Rename Function for Consistency

- Keep the existing `write_edi` function to maintain backward compatibility
- Add a new `write_835` function that calls `write_edi` to provide a consistent API
- Update the lib.rs file to re-export both functions

### 2. Refactor Error Handling Gradually

- Implement a phased approach to updating the error handling
- Start by adding Result types to new functions while maintaining the existing behavior
- Gradually update existing functions to use the new error handling patterns
- Ensure backward compatibility throughout the refactoring process

### 3. Update Documentation

- Document the function naming conventions
- Explain the error handling patterns
- Provide examples of how to use the API correctly
