# EDI Parser Phase 1 Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to implement Phase 1 of the EDI Parser project, focusing on fixing the CTX segment implementation in the 999 format, improving error handling, and addressing Table 1 content placement issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. CTX Segment Implementation

The CTX segment implementation has been completely rewritten to conform to the 999 standards. Key changes include:

- Renamed fields to match X12 standards:
  - `ctx01_context_id` → `ctx01_context_name`
  - `ctx06_ref_in_segment` → `ctx06_reference_in_segment`

- Fixed parsing logic to correctly extract all elements from the segment
  - Previous implementation had bugs where it was always using index 3 for multiple fields
  - Now properly handles all situational elements

- Improved writing logic to only include non-empty fields
  - Previous implementation was incorrectly formatting the output
  - Now follows proper EDI formatting rules for situational elements

- Added comprehensive unit tests to verify correct behavior

### 2. Loop2110 Implementation

The Loop2110 implementation has been updated to properly handle CTX segments:

- Changed CTX from a single element to a vector to support multiple CTX segments
- Improved parsing logic to handle all CTX segments that follow an IK4 segment
- Updated writing logic to output all CTX segments in the correct order

### 3. Loop2100 Implementation

The Loop2100 implementation has been simplified and improved:

- Consolidated multiple CTX segment types into a single vector
- Improved parsing logic to handle all CTX segments that follow an IK3 segment
- Updated writing logic to output all CTX segments in the correct order

### 4. Loop2000 Implementation

The Loop2000 implementation has been updated for better structure and error handling:

- Improved field naming for clarity
- Enhanced parsing logic to better handle the loop structure
- Updated writing logic to ensure proper segment order

### 5. Error Handling Improvements

The helper functions have been enhanced with better error handling:

- Added null checks to prevent panics when segments aren't found
- Improved logging to provide better diagnostic information
- Made functions more robust against malformed input

### 6. Table 1 Content Placement

The Table 1 content placement has been improved:

- Restructured the controller to properly organize Table 1 content
- Created a Table1Combined structure to maintain proper relationships between components
- Improved JSON to EDI conversion for 999 format
- Enhanced command-line argument handling for better format detection

## Testing

Unit tests have been added for all modified components to ensure correct behavior:

- CTX segment parsing and writing
- Loop2110 structure and processing
- Loop2100 structure and processing
- Loop2000 structure and processing
- Table 1 content placement

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing with additional real-world 999 files
2. Enhance error handling and validation
3. Begin planning for Phase 2 implementation
