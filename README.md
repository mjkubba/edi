# EDI Parser and Processor for Healthcare X12 Formats in Rust

This project provides a robust Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) parser and processor specifically designed for healthcare X12 formats. It supports multiple transaction sets including 835 (Payment/Remittance Advice), 999 (Implementation Acknowledgment), 270/271 (Eligibility), 276/277 (Claim Status), and 837 (Claims).

## Project Status

- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete - Fixed CTX segment implementation, improved error handling, addressed Table 1 content placement
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Complete - Implemented common infrastructure and additional transaction sets (270/271, 276/277)
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - Implementing 837 transaction sets and performance optimizations

The parser implements support for EDI X12 segment handling, including interchange control, functional groups, and transaction sets. It features specialized modules for processing healthcare-specific loops and segments, making it particularly valuable for healthcare claims processing systems and medical billing applications. The implementation follows strict EDI standards while providing a developer-friendly API for parsing and generating EDI documents.

## Features

- **Multiple Transaction Set Support**: 835, 999, 270/271, 276/277, with 837 in progress
- **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: Segment and loop definitions are configurable
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and validation
- **Bidirectional Conversion**: EDI to JSON and JSON to EDI
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new transaction sets and segments
- **Special Format Handling**: Support for complex CTX segments and other special formats

## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (1.56.0 or later)
- Cargo package manager
- Environment with logging capabilities for debug output

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd edi

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

## Run application
cargo run
```

### Command Line Options
```
-f <file>     Input file path (EDI or JSON)
-o <file>     Output file path
-w            Write mode (convert JSON to EDI)
-j            Specify input is JSON
-h, --help    Show help information
```

### Examples
```bash
# Convert EDI to JSON
cargo run -- -f input.edi -o output.json

# Convert JSON to EDI
cargo run -- -f input.json -o output.edi -w -j
```
