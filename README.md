## Purpose
Playground to read EDI files, starting with 835 because why not!   
I'm not new to MMIS systems but wanted to get deeper in the claims processing part, and what a better way to learn a system than building parts of it!   
First iteration is to read the the file contents and parse it's components, get famililar with the loops and segments Then phase 2 write the file itself from other sources

I'm writing this in rust but in python style, as I'm still learning rust!

I'm using Amazon CodeWhisperer to help me with this new endeavour if there are any code references I'll include them here.
