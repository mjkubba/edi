It supports multiple transaction sets including 835 (Payment/Remittance Advice), 999 (Implementation Acknowledgment), 270/271 (Eligibility), 276/277 (Claim Status), 278 (Health Care Services Review), 837P/I/D (Claims), and 820 (Health Insurance Exchange Related Payments).

## Project Status

> **📊 Current Status**: See [VALIDATION_REPORT.md](./VALIDATION_REPORT.md) for comprehensive testing results and current system validation  
> **📚 Implementation Details**: See [AmazonQ.md](./AmazonQ.md) for detailed development history and technical architecture

| EDI999 (Implementation Acknowledgment) | ✅ Complete | Fully functional with special CTX segment handling for both standard and special formats |
| EDI276/277 (Health Care Claim Status) | ✅ Functional | Functional with differences in output, core functionality working correctly including TRN and STC segments |
| EDI278 (Health Care Services Review) | ✅ Functional | Functional with correct handling of AR/HS prefixes in UM segment, some segments missing in output (DTP, SV2, PRV) |
| EDI837P (Health Care Claim Professional) | ✅ Functional | Functional with differences in output, core functionality working correctly but missing several segments |
| EDI837I (Health Care Claim Institutional) | ✅ Functional | Functional with specialized handling for CL1 segment, missing several segments in output |
| EDI837D (Health Care Claim Dental) | ✅ Functional | Functional with specialized handling for TOO segment, core functionality working correctly |
| EDI820 (Health Insurance Exchange Related Payments) | ⚠️ Partial | Partially functional with many missing segments in output (N1, ENT, NM1, RMR, DTM) |
| EDI834 (Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance) | ❌ Not Implemented | Format not currently recognized by the parser |

## Features

- **Multiple Transaction Set Support**: 835, 999, 270/271, 276/277, 278, 837P/I/D, 820
- **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: Segment and loop definitions are configurable
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and validation
- **Bidirectional Conversion**: EDI to JSON and JSON to EDI
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new transaction sets and segments
- **Special Format Handling**: Support for complex CTX segments and other special formats
- **Variant-Specific Components**: Specialized handling for format-specific segments like TOO in 837D and CL1 in 837I
- **Prefix Support**: Handling for special prefixes like AR/HS in UM segments for 278 transaction sets

## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (1.56.0 or later)
- Cargo package manager
- Environment with logging capabilities for debug output

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd edi

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Command Line Options
```
-f <file>     Input file path (EDI or JSON)
-o <file>     Output file path
-w            Write mode (convert JSON to EDI)
-j            Specify input is JSON
-h, --help    Show help information
```

### Examples
```bash
# Convert EDI to JSON
cargo run -- -f input.edi -o output.json

# Convert JSON to EDI
cargo run -- -f input.json -o output.edi -w -j
```

## Testing Methodology
- Parse EDI files to JSON and verify structure
- Generate EDI files from JSON and verify structure
- Compare original and generated EDI files
- Identify unprocessed segments and structural differences

```bash
# Parse EDI to JSON
cargo run -- -f ./demo/edi835-1.edi -o ./demo/test835-new.json

# Generate EDI from JSON
cargo run -- -f ./demo/test835-new.json -o ./demo/test835-new.edi -w -j

# Compare files
diff ./demo/edi835-1.edi ./demo/test835-new.edi
```
